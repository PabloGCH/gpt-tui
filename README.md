DESCRIPTION
==============================

A TUI for CHATGPT writen in rust i am making to learn and practice the use of the rust language.
Feel free to use it and open issues if you think something doesn't work, should be written in a
better way, or if you have a feature request.
Since this is a learning project i will not be accepting pull requests, because i want to do add
features and refactor the code myself.

USAGE
==============================

- Clone the repo.
- Make a environment variable called OPENAI_KEY and set it to your openai key.
- Use cargo run to run the program or cargo build to build it.
if you build it you can drop the binary in your bin folder and run it from anywhere
